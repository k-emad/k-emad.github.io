I’m Emad Koohjani, an economist with a passion for understanding markets, crafting data-driven solutions, and simplifying complex economic ideas. Currently based in Tehran, I study Economics at Allameh Tabataba’i University, focusing deeply on econometrics, data analysis, and visualization.

Professionally, I'm a Co-founder at a market research startup and an Economic Researcher at Vandad Capital, where I specialize in market sizing, analyzing risk, and providing insightful financial consulting to businesses navigating economic uncertainty. I also dedicate my time to teaching economics courses, helping others connect theory to real-world applications.
